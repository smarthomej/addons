# Telenot Binding

_The Telenot binding connects the Telenot Complex 400 to openHAB or compatible systems._

_It is able to read the states of the contacts and the security areas._

## Hardware

To get the serial data to the ethernet bus use the following converter or another like this: USR-TCP232-302 Tiny - RS232 to Ethernet TCP-IP-Server-Modul. 
Connect this module to the GMS-Port (Serial).
You have to enable the GMS-Protocol in the CompasX Software.

## Note

The Building management protocol is a two-way street. 
Not only can you get info from your alarm system, that same protocol can be used to send commands to the alarm system too! 
A black hatter might use this to tell your system to disarm itself using the cimmunications infrastructure that we have conveniently built for him. 
While we will not use those functions in our integration, someone that knows the right binary data to send can disable the system without setting foot into your home and entering the security code or otherwise authenticate himself to the system. 
Especially if you have a clause in your theft protection policy, that you are only covered if the alarm system is turned on, I can only strongly discourage you from enabling the building management protocol on your alarm system.
You have been warned! Take care that you protect your home installation, and make sure that you have locked down external access properly. 
At the very least, Iâ€™d recommend using a proper firewall and VPN server rather than just drilling holes into your NAT and exposing ports.
Assuming that you have adressed those issues successfully, let me explain the setup, shown in the picture below.

## Supported Things

The binding supports the following thing types:

* `ipbridge` - Supports TCP connection to the serial tcp adapter.
* `input` - Telenot reporting group (Discovery)
* `output` - Telenot reporting rrea (Discovery)
* `mb` - Reports the reporting area.
* `mp` - Reports the inputs (contacts).
* `sb` - Reports the security area.
* `emaState` - Reports the state of the system.

## Discovery

You have to enable discovery in the ipbridge thing.
After turning on the discovery will start and the switch goes to off

## Thing Configuration

### ipbridge

The `ipbridge` thing supports a TCP/IP connection to an RS323 to LAN adapter.

* `hostname` (required) The hostname or IP address of the serial to LAN adapter
* `tcpPort` (default = 4116) TCP port number for the serial to LAN adapter connection
* `discovery` Enables the discovery
* `reconnect` (1-60, default = 2) The period in minutes that the handler will wait between connection checks and connection attempts
* `timeout` (0-60, default = 5) The period in minutes after which the connection will be reset if no valid messages have been received. Set to 0 to disable.

Thing config file example:

```
Bridge telenot:ipbridge:device [ hostname="xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx", tcpPort=4116 ] {
  Thing ...
  Thing ...
}
```

### `input`

The `input` thing provides all channels with the state of each single reporting group.

### `ouput`

The `input` thing provides all channels with the state of each single reporting area.

### `mb`

The `mb` thing provides the state of each single reporting area (Meldebereich).

* `address` (required) The number of reporting area.

### `mp`

The `mp` thing provides the state of each single reporting point (Meldepunkt).

* `address` (required) The number of reporting ponit.

### `sb`

The `sb` thing provides the state of each single security area (Sicherungsbereich).

* `address` (required) The number of security area.


### `emaState`

The `emaState` thing currently provides the state of the system.
