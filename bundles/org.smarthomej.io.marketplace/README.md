# JSON Marketplace

The JSON marketplace provides additional addons.
The current version supports the SmartHome/J bindings with the latest stable release.

## Installation

Make the marketplace bundle available to your openHAB 3.2 or openHAB 3.2 compatible instance.
For openHAB this is as simple as dropping the .jar-file in the addons folder.
On Debian systems this is usually `/usr/share/openhab/addons`, on Windows systems `<openhabDirectory>\addons`.

## Using SmartHome/J Bindings

A new "Other addons" section below the "Community Marketplace" will show up.
Installation of an addon works in the same way as for distribution or Commmunity Marketplace addons.

**Attention:** Make sure that you do not install two versions of the same binding.
You might run into severe trouble otherwise.
